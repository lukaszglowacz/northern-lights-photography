# Northern Lights Photo Trip Project

## User Experience (UX)
### Wireframes
The wireframes for the website were produced in Balsamiq. There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

### Design Choices
- Typography
  - The fonts chosen were 'Oswald' for the headings and 'Poppins' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively.
  - Poppins is an easily readable font, and Oswald was selected via https://typ.io/search
  
- Colour Scheme
  - The leading color is a shade of green, which fits perfectly with the theme of the Northern Lights.
  - The colors were selected via http://colormind.io/

## Features
